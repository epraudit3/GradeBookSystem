# Title: Grade Book System in C

# Description:
This program, written in C, functions as a simple grade book system. It was developed as part of COP 3223c, Intro to Programming with C, coursework. The program allows for managing a class of students, including adding and removing students, along with tracking their homework, quiz, and exam scores.

# Features:
-Add new student records.
-Remove existing student records.
-Calculate weighted scores for students based on homework, quiz, and exam grades.

# How to Compile and Run:
-Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
-Compile the program using a command like gcc largeprogram4_Epan_Zandryn.c -o gradebook.
-Run the executable in the terminal: ./gradebook.

# Usage:
The program presents a menu to interact with. Options include adding or removing students and viewing student information. Input is handled via standard console input.

# Reflections:
This project was an introduction to structuring larger C programs, managing arrays of structures, and handling file input/output. It was challenging to ensure proper memory management and data validation.

# Future Improvements:
-Using dynamic memory allocation to handle a school of students
-Implement a graphical user interface.
-Extend functionality to include more detailed student profiles.
